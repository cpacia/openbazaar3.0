; ==============================================================================
                         WARNING -- DANGER ZONE -- WARNING
; OpenBazaar uses the same peer ID for all sessions. If you connect to the OpenBazaar
; network even once in the clear, your real IP address may be permanently mapped to your
; peer ID and visible to peers on the network. If you are intending to use Tor to mask
; your IP address, you must NEVER start OpenBazaar without using Tor. Not even on the
; first start. Tor must be configured and used on every single startup. If you
; accidentally started OpenBazaar without using Tor, you MUST delete your data directory
; and start over. Deleting the data directory will force OpenBazaar to use a different
; peer ID. You will lose any listings, orders, or coins you have saved if you do so.
; ==============================================================================

; Tor mode will proxy all outgoing connections through the Tor network. By default
; it will disable listening for incoming connections unless the onion option is used.
; This option will try to connect to the Tor SOCKS5 proxy on 127.0.0.1:9050 and
; 127.0.0.1:9150. In other words, you must have either the Tor browser or Tor daemon
; running on localhost. If it is not running OpenBazaar will not start.
; If you wish to use a different proxy URL specify it with the proxy option.
; tor=1

; Onion mode listen for incoming connections exclusively through the Tor network.
; Typically you want to this option in combination with the tor option so that both
; incoming and outgoing connections will be proxied through Tor. This mode is not
; required, however as OpenBazaar can operate using only outgoing connections.
; By default this will try to connect to the Tor control port on 127.0.0.1:9151 or
; 127.0.0.1:9051 and programatically configure itself as a Tor hidden service. If
; this operation fails OpenBazaar will continue without accepting incoming connections
; and will note this in the logs.
; onion=1

; If the Tor control port requires authentication you may enter the username and
; password here.
; onionuser=alice
; onionpass=5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8

; Dual stack mode will accept incoming connections thorugh both Tor AND the clear
; internet. Therefore dualstack mode is NOT private. Outgoing connections will be
; made over the clear internet unless talking to a node running exclusively behind
; Tor.
; dualstack=1

; If you wish to use a different proxy URL, specify it here. Note that you must
; still specify the tor option to use Tor. Only setting this proxy URL is not enough.
; proxy=127.0.0.1:9050

; If you wish to use a different URL for the Tor control you may enter it here. Note
; that you must still specify the onion option to accept incoming connections over Tor.
; Ony setting this Tor control URL is not enough.
; torcontrol=127.0.0.1:9051

; API Settings - The following options
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; You may wish to enable SSL on the API connection. This is hightly recommended
; if you are running the server on a remote machine as failure to use SSL will
; allow anyone to connect to and control your node, including draining the wallet.
; ssl=1

; To use SSL you will need to also specify the paths to both the cert and key files
; for your certificate.
; sslcertfile=/path/to/ssl.cert
; sslkeyfile=/path/to/ssl.key

; The following are the basic auth credentials for the API if you wish to use
; authentication. Note that you must use both SSL AND authentication to protect
; a remote server. It's also highly recommend that you use authentication even
; on localhost to prevent other programs from accessing the API.
; Take note that the API password below must be the hex encoded SHA256 hash of
; the actual password. This is done to protect the password while it sits here
; in the config file. When you make an API request you will pass in the un-hashed
; password and the hash will be compared to the hash saved here.

;apipassword=5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8

; As an alternative to basic auth you can use cookie based authentication. The
; primary use case for this is for programs that programatically start the server
; to protect the API. We do not recommend actually setting this value in this config
; but rather passing it in through the command line options as this is not hashed
; the way the basic auth password is.
