; OpenBazaar uses the same peer ID for all sessions. If you connect to the OpenBazaar
; network even once in the clear, your real IP address may be permanently mapped to your
; peer ID and visible to peers on the network. If you are intending to use Tor to mask
; your IP address, you must NEVER start OpenBazaar without using Tor. Not even on the
; first start. Tor must be configured and used on every single startup. If you
; accidentally started OpenBazaar without using Tor, you MUST delete your data directory
; and start over. Deleting the data directory will force OpenBazaar to use a different
; peer ID. You will lose any listings, orders, or coins you have saved if you do so.
; ==============================================================================

; Tor mode will start an embedded Tor daemon proxy both incoming and outgoing connections
; over the Tor network. This mode uses Tor exclusively and not the clear internet.
; tor=1

; Dual stack mode will accept incoming connections thorugh both Tor AND the clear
; internet. Therefore dualstack mode is NOT private. Outgoing connections will be
; made over the clear internet unless talking to a node running exclusively behind
; Tor.

; Node Settings - The following options
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; The number of responses to wait for when making IPNS queries. This is a tradeoff
; between the accuracy of the query and the speed.
; ipnsquorum=2

; Disable the use of IPNS Pubsub. You probably want to do this if your node is going
; is going to be making a large number of IPNS queries as it will use less memory and
; bandwidth.
; noipnsps=1

; API URL to use for exchange rates. Must conform to the BitcoinAverage format.

; API Settings - The following options
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; You may wish to enable SSL on the API connection. This is hightly recommended
; if you are running the server on a remote machine as failure to use SSL will
; allow anyone to connect to and control your node, including draining the wallet.
; ssl=1

; To use SSL you will need to also specify the paths to both the cert and key files
; for your certificate.
; sslcertfile=/path/to/ssl.cert
; sslkeyfile=/path/to/ssl.key

; The following are the basic auth credentials for the API if you wish to use
; authentication. Note that you must use both SSL AND authentication to protect
; a remote server. It's also highly recommend that you use authentication even
; on localhost to prevent other programs from accessing the API.
; Take note that the API password below must be the hex encoded SHA256 hash of
; the actual password. This is done to protect the password while it sits here
; in the config file. When you make an API request you will pass in the un-hashed
; password and the hash will be compared to the hash saved here.
;apiusername=alice
;apipassword=5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8

; As an alternative to basic auth you can use cookie based authentication. The
; primary use case for this is for programs that programatically start the server
; to protect the API. We do not recommend actually setting this value in this config
; but rather passing it in through the command line options as this is not hashed
; the way the basic auth password is.

; CORS is enabled by default. To disable set the following to false.

; Store And Forward Server Settings - The following options

; Enabling the store-and-forward server will allow this node to offer store and
; forward services to the network. Other nodes will be able to push messages intended
; for offline peers and those nodes will be able to retrieve the messages when they
; come back online. Note this is a power user setting. Running this server should
; typically be done on a box with a lot of power and storage as you may be storing
; a good deal of data.
